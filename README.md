I have added scenarios under **login_scenarios.feature** file. This can be open in text file or visual code (Any IDE)
I have automated one scenario using XPATH and code can be seen under **login.py** file
To run the code install python then open the login.py file in VS Code. Then open terminal of visual code and runt his command **python login.py**
